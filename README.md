### Description

This repo contains tools to construct JEDI configuration YAMLs using Jinja2 templating. The repo itself does not contain any JEDI configuration files. It is designed to be a tool that is useful to the community by defining a common way of assembling JEDI configuration files using an industry standard (Jinja2) templating mechanism. Optional dependencies of JCB can be added, where these dependent repos contain the actual configuration files for JEDI. These repos can be controlled by the relevant parties and compatibility ensured through testing mechanisms.
